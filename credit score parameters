 Key Parameters Used to Calculate Credit Scores

 1. Payment History (35-40%)
- Timely repayment of loans, credit cards, and EMIs positively impacts the score.
- Late payments, defaults, or settlements lower the score significantly.
- Even one missed payment can reduce the score drastically.

 2. Credit Utilization Ratio (20-30%)
- Measures the percentage of credit limit used vs. total credit available.
- Ideal Utilization: Below 30% (e.g., if you have a ₹1,00,000 limit, try not to use more than ₹30,000).
- High utilization signals over-dependence on credit and lowers the score.

 3. Credit Mix (10-15%)
- A mix of secured loans (home loan, car loan) and unsecured loans (credit cards, personal loans) improves creditworthiness.
- Too many unsecured loans negatively impact the score.

 4. Length of Credit History (15-20%)
- Older credit accounts improve the score as they show a long history of responsible borrowing.
- Closing old credit cards can reduce the average credit age and lower the score.

 5. Number of Hard Inquiries (10%)
- Each time you apply for a loan or credit card, banks check your credit report (this is called a hard inquiry).
- Too many inquiries in a short time (within 3-6 months) signal credit hunger and lower the score.
- Soft inquiries (checking your own score) don’t impact your credit score.

 6. Outstanding Debt / Credit Repayment Behavior (10%)
- If you have a high outstanding loan amount with no consistent repayments, it lowers the score.
- Partial or minimum due payments on credit cards can negatively impact the score over time.

 7. Recent Credit Behavior & New Accounts (5-10%)
- Opening multiple credit accounts in a short time can lower the score.
- Closing too many credit accounts at once can also impact the score.

 8. Negative Remarks (Penalty Factor)
- Loan write-offs, defaults, settled accounts, or bankruptcy significantly lower the credit score.
- Legal actions or fraud alerts on the credit report severely affect creditworthiness.
